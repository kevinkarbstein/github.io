I am an evolutionary biologist and botanist who uses bioinformatic and machine learning methods and tools to study past and present evolutionary processes. My research interests cover phylogenomics, morphometrics, und integrative taxonomy, with a particular focus on polyploidy, hybridization, and asexuality in plants. Recently, I've been diving into pipeline programming and deep learning approaches. My work has been published in internationally renowned journals including _New Phytologist_ and _Trends in Ecology & Evolution_.

I'm a PostDoc at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena and Guest Researcher at the Florida Museum of Natural History of the University of Florida. I am seeking creative graduate students, PhD students, and postdocs interested in using machine learning and other computational approaches to address fundamental questions in evolutionary and biodiversity research. Please [email me](mailto:kevin.karbstein@uni-jena.de) me for more information on current opportunities in the lab of [Integrative Taxonomy in Plants](https://www.bio.uni-jena.de/18018/integrative-taxonomie-der-pflanzen) at the FSU Jena.
